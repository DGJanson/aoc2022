# Advent of code 2022 Clojure

The 2022 advent of code with some solutions in clojure. This is the first time I have used this language. And it shows... Let's see how far I'll get.

### Repo

To use the code in this repo you can simply clone / download. You need to have clojure installed of course. Then you can simply run the clojure command and pass it the day you want to solve. The Advent data is included in this repo as well. Example:

```
clojure -X:day4
```

To run on the testset, simply append the word test to the day.

```
clojure -X:day6test
```

You can see in the deps.edn which days are there and can be used :)
